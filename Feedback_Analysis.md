# Machine Learning Report: Feedback Data Analysis

## Problem Statement

The aim of this study is to analyze the segmentation of the Intel Certification course participants based on their satisfaction levels. The objective is to understand the distribution of satisfaction and identify areas for potential improvement.

## Introduction

The relevance of feedback analysis lies in its ability to gauge the effectiveness of educational programs. Feedback provides actionable insights that can improve course design, content, delivery, and overall organization, thereby enhancing the learning experience and aligning it with industry standards.

## Methodology

The methodology employed combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML) for a comprehensive approach. EDA is utilized to visualize the distribution of data across various faculties and assess content quality, effectiveness, expertise, relevance, and overall organization. ML techniques, specifically K-means clustering, are applied to segment the feedback data, with the Elbow method used to identify the optimal number of clusters.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA, depicted in the images, presents a faculty-wise distribution of data. It shows that Mrs. Akshara Sasidharan and Mrs. Veena A Kumar account for the majority of sessions, with a balanced distribution among the other faculty members. Boxplots indicate that the overall quality ratings for content, effectiveness, expertise, relevance, and organization are consistently high across all resource persons.

Branch-wise analysis further demonstrates that perceptions of content quality are relatively consistent across different academic branches.

### Faculty-Wise Distribution of Data

- The dataset consists of feedback from students across different branches and for different resource persons.
- There are 4 unique branches and 4 resource persons.
- The faculty-wise distribution of data shows varied responses for each faculty member, indicating the breadth of feedback across the sessions.

## Summary of Responses
  
### Content Quality

- The feedback data were further analyzed to understand the content quality across different branches.
- The distribution indicates that while the content quality is generally rated high, there are a few outliers suggesting room for improvement, especially in the ECE and IMCA branches.

### Machine Learning Model to Study Segmentation: K-means Clustering

The Elbow method graph indicates that a cluster size of 3 may be appropriate, as evidenced by the elbow point in the graph. The K-means clustering algorithm, applied with this number of clusters, segments the participants into distinct groups, possibly indicating varying levels of satisfaction.

- The Elbow method was employed to determine the optimal number of clusters. The graph indicates that the sum of squares within clusters decreases significantly up to 5 clusters and then plateaus, suggesting that 5 might be the appropriate number of clusters.

## Results and Conclusion

The clustering outcomes suggest three distinct levels of participant satisfaction, ranging from high to moderate to areas requiring attention. The scatter plot with cluster centroids reveals the distribution of these segments in terms of effectiveness and expertise.

In conclusion, the analysis effectively segments participant satisfaction, providing a nuanced understanding of how the course meets learner expectations. This segmentation enables targeted improvements to course content and delivery, ensuring that the Intel Certification course continues to evolve in response to participant feedback and industry demands.

This report, based on the analysis of visual and statistical data, suggests that the Intel Certification course is well-received in terms of content and delivery. However, there is an opportunity for further refinement to enhance participant satisfaction and ensure the course's ongoing relevance and effectiveness.

### Visualizations

- Boxplots were created for each feedback metric across the resource persons and branches. These visualizations provide insights into the distribution and variance of the ratings, highlighting the strengths and potential areas for improvement.
- The clustering visualization shows how students are grouped based on their feedback on effectiveness and expertise, which can be useful for targeted improvements in course delivery and content.

### Expert Recommendations

- Focus on branches with lower median content quality scores for targeted improvements.
- Leverage the strengths of resource persons with higher median scores to train or mentor others.
- Investigate the outliers in effectiveness and expertise to understand specific concerns or issues.
- Utilize clustering information to understand the different segments of student satisfaction and tailor further improvements accordingly.

### Data Quality and Completeness

- The dataset appears to be complete with no missing values, ensuring a high level of data quality for this analysis.
